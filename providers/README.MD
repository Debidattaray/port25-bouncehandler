Bounce provider plugins should be placed in this directory and then loaded via `setup.php`

## feedback-loop-processor.php
Still work-in-progress and I anticipate more changes in it as we receive FBL reports. For now I suggest that you go through the `feedback-loop-processor.php` and adjust settings. In the near future, I will move settings to `setup.php`.

FBLs tested against:
- Yahoo!-Mail-Feedback/2.0 (arf)
- Outlook/Hotmail - not tested - if you happen to get a FBL record, please pass it on or let me know if RFC/ARF actually works.
